22. A group of travelers embark on world tours starting with their home cities. Each traveler has an undecided itinerary that evolves over the course of the tour. Some travelers decide to abruptly end their journey mid-travel and live in their last destination.
Given the dataset of dates on which they travelled between different pairs of cities, can you find out how many travellers ended back in their home city? For simplicity, you can assume that each traveler made at most one trip between two cities in a day.

select count(*) as no_of_travelers 
from (select th1.traveler, th1.start_city
      from travel_history th1
      join (select traveler, min(date) as start_date, max(date) as end_date
            from travel_history
            group by traveler) th2
      on th1.traveler = th2.traveler and th1.date = th2.start_date) th
join (select th1.traveler, th1.end_city
      from travel_history th1
      join (select traveler, min(date) as start_date, max(date) as end_date
            from travel_history
            group by traveler) th3
      on th1.traveler = th3.traveler and th1.date = th3.end_date) th4
on th.traveler = th4.traveler
where start_city = end_city;

23. The election is conducted in a city and everyone can vote for one or more candidates, or choose not to vote at all. Each person has 1 vote so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across these candidates. For example, if a person votes for 2 candidates, these candidates receive an equivalent of 0.5 vote each.
Find out who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the candidate or multiple names in case of a tie. To avoid issues with a floating-point error you can round the number of votes received by a candidate to 3 decimal places.

select v.candidate 
from (select vr.candidate, sum(vs.vote_share) as total_votes
      from voting_results vr
      join (select voter, round(1/count(*),3) as vote_share
            from voting_results
            group by voter) vs
      on vr.voter = vs.voter
      group by vr.candidate) v
where v.total_votes = (
select max(v.total_votes) as max_votes
from (select vr.candidate, sum(vs.vote_share) as total_votes
      from voting_results vr
      join (select voter, round(1/count(*),3) as vote_share
            from voting_results
            group by voter) vs
      on vr.voter = vs.voter
      group by vr.candidate) v
      where v.candidate is not null)
;

24. For each video, find how many unique users flagged it. A unique user can be identified using the combination of their first name and last name. Do not consider rows in which there is no flag ID.

select u.video_id, count(distinct u.fullname) as no_of_users
from (select video_id, flag_id, concat(ifnull(user_firstname, ''),' ',ifnull(user_lastname,'')) as fullname
      from user_flags
      where flag_id is not null) u
group by u.video_id;

25. Which user flagged the most distinct videos that ended up approved by YouTube? Output, in one column, their full name or names in case of a tie. In the user's full name, include a space between the first and the last name.

select ufs.fullname 
from (select uf.fullname, count(distinct uf.video_id) as n_videos
      from (select concat(ifnull(user_firstname,''),' ',ifnull(user_lastname,'')) as fullname, u.video_id, u.flag_id, reviewed_outcome 
            from user_flags u
            join flag_review f
            on u.flag_id = f.flag_id) uf
      where uf.reviewed_outcome = 'APPROVED'
      group by uf.fullname) ufs
where ufs.n_videos = (select max(ufs.n_videos)
                      from (select uf.fullname, count(distinct uf.video_id) as n_videos
      from (select concat(ifnull(user_firstname,''),' ',ifnull(user_lastname,'')) as fullname, u.video_id, u.flag_id, reviewed_outcome 
            from user_flags u
            join flag_review f
            on u.flag_id = f.flag_id) uf
      where uf.reviewed_outcome = 'APPROVED'
      group by uf.fullname) ufs);
